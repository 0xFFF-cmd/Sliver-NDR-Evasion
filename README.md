is a customized version of the Sliver C2 framework, focused on network traffic obfuscation to enhance stealth and bypass Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions.

This project modifies Sliver's traffic patterns, payload signatures, and communication methods to reduce detection by modern behavioral and network monitoring systems during red team operations and adversary simulations.

Features

    Customized network traffic to evade NDR inspection

    Enhanced payload delivery and beaconing obfuscation

    Designed for stealthy C2 communications
